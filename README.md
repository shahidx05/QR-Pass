## 📍 Problem
Managing entry for college fests and technical events is often slow and inefficient.  
Traditional methods like **paper passes and physical lists** lead to:
- Long queues ⏳  
- Lost tickets 📄  
- Inaccurate attendance data 📊  

This makes it difficult for organizers to manage events and plan for the future.

- 🎫 Attendees can generate a unique **QR code pass** in seconds (no login required).  
- 🎉 Organizers get a **secure dashboard** to create events and track attendance in real-time.
